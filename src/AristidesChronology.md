Cornelius Nepos states that Aristides died four years after Themistocles was ostracized. 
Events: Death of Aristides the Just, Ostracism of Themistocles 

Sources: Cornelius Nepos "Lives of Famous Men", Plutarch "Life of Themistocles" & "Life of Aristides", Aeschylus "The Persians" 

Chronological Systems: Nepos says (3.3) that Aristides died “about 4 years” after the ostracism of Themistocles in Athens. Diodorus dates Athenian archons. 


Cornelius Nepos in 3.3 states that Aristides died four years after Themistocles was ostracized (decessit autem fere post annum quartum quam Themistocles Athenis erat expulsus). His Latin makes it clear that he means four years from the initial expulsion, not the end of his ostracism period. Therefore, dating the death of Aristides is reliant on dating the ostracism of Themistocles. 

Diodorus states in 11.54-55 that Themistocles was ostracized when Praxiergus was archon in Athens, placing the event in 471 B.C.E. 


Pericles produced Aeschylus' *The Persians* in 472 and due to the play's indirect tribute to Themistocles, Peter Green takes this as evidence that it was meant to influence the outcome of his trial (115-116).  The hypothesis to the play in Florence, Laurentian manuscript 32.9, records that *The Persians* was part of the first-place trilogy in the archonship of Menon.

Plutarch acknowledges difficulties in chronology in section 27 of his *Life of Themistocles*. He says that according to Thucydides and Charon of Lampsacus, Themistocles spoke with Artaxerxes while according to Ephorus, Dinon, Clitarchus, Heracleides, and many other authorities he spoke with Xerxes. Artaxerxes did not succeed his father until 465 B.C.E. 

These sources in conjunction with Cornelius Nepos' account put Aristides' death either in 468 or 461 B.C.E. 

Either way, Aristides would have died before 454 B.C.E. when the treasury was moved from Delos to Athens. But Plutarch has Aristides commenting on this event, "Aristides said that the proposal was unjust, but that it was to Athens' advantage." (section 25)
