Athenian Tribute Lists that are incredibly complex and fragmentary primary source documents from the fifth century BC
Title: Reassesment- looking at primary source evidence- stones 
Before explaining why my editorial method and analyses--what I’ve done-- matter 
First:  historical background to convince you why these inscriptions matter

## Persia and Greece ##
Map of Persian Empire (500 BCE) 
**Point out how tiny Greece is***
***Point out Phaselis*** example used throughout presentation 
490&480- Persia tried and remarkably failed to invade Greece
In 478/7 B.C. a naval alliance was formed in order to be prepared for future Persian attacks 

## Delian League ##
Delos picture: the league’s treasury was originally kept on the island of Delos 
Modern name
sacred to the god Apollo & a neutral site
Member states/allies either contributed triremes (specialized war ships) or tribute (cash)
##Tribute##
each state paid annually
phoros= term for cash contributions
Coin: tribute was most commonly paid in silver coins
the vast majority of states contributed money because triremes were very expensive and difficult to produce
 different states paid different amounts depending on their size and resources
##Acropolis ##
At a later date the treasury was moved to the Acropolis in Athens- the most prominent part in the city, sacred to Athena (Athens’ namesake goddess)- no longer a neutral site
##Parthenon##
after move, Athenians kept records of the quota for Athena
stelae displayed publicly

## The Athenian Tribute Lists##
ATL Overview picture
by far the largest block of marble ever used for an inscription in Athens--important to Athenians--send a messaage 
displayed publicly and meant to be permanent records
quota lists: απαρχαι (“first-fruits”) given annually as offerings to Athena- 1/60th of total tribute
Athena is protecting the League’s funds, so part of the money is set aside for her 
today the inscriptions are kept in the Epigraphic Museum in Athens- badly damaged, majority of the stelae you see are reconstructed plaster- evidence is fragmentary by nature hundreds of fragments 

## Complex evidence demands new approaches ##
go back to primary source evidence & study the stones themselves
NOT ONLY: fragmentary
BUT ALSO: multidimensional- chronology, geography, numerical figures, group payments, multiple payments by same state, late & partial payments etc.

##Stele 1 & Me## 
When I was studying abroad in Athens, I got permission to study and photograph the inscriptions. 
My original photography- only readily available photos of the material
edit the source text directly from the primary photographic evidence
size of the inscriptions- they are inscribed on all four sides- I’ve edited the entire front face of this stele & the right lateral face--first 8 years= most extensively preserved
can view them alongside one another
this has never been possible in a print edition
