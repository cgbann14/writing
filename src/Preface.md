# Preface #



This paper is one part of a larger project conducted through the Mellon Summer Research Program and the College Honors Program at the College of the Holy Cross. The components of this project are: 

- an archive of original photography the photos of the inscriptions (taken at the Epigraphic Museum in Athens)
- an archive of TEI-conformant XML editions, including both diplomatic and normalized  texts, for each year, together with delimited-text data files for related information (e.g., geographic information about locations referred to in the texts)
- code for viewing and working with the archival material in a web interface (delivered as a java servlet)
- a virtual machine that runs the servlet interface from any machine with the open-source Virtual Box (<https://www.virtualbox.org/>)  and Vagrant (<http://www.vagrantup.com/>)  software for running virtual machines


The diplomatic edition referred to throughout this paper is not printed here, since it is a digital edition. The images in Chapter 5: "Applications and Visualizations" are screenshots of the web interface to the digital edition. All work for the project is publicly available online at <http://phoros.github.io/> which is a github repository that allows people to collaborate on open source projects. This address has links to the software for viewing the material and a virtual machine for running the viewing software interactively. All the components are part of the digital version of this project filed with Crossworks. The bibliography on the Athenian Tribute Quota Lists is massive, and I have read widely on the subject, mostly in English but also in Greek. In the appended list of "Sources Consulted," I have included references to the most important sources I have used, but in the text of this paper, I try as far as possible to cite only the primary evidence of the inscriptions themselves. This paper is meant as a guide to understanding the Athenian Tribute Quota Lists, the principles I have defined for work on this edition, and a guide to the future study of Athenian imperial tribute.
