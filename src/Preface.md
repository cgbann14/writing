# Preface #



This paper is one part of a larger project conducted through the Mellon Summer Research Program and the College Honors Program at the College of the Holy Cross. The components of this project are: 

- an archive of original photography the photos of the inscriptions (taken at the Epigraphic Museum in Athens)
- an archive TEI-conformant XML editions, including both diplomatic and normalized  texts, for each year, together with delimited-text data files for related information (e.g., geographic information about locations referred to in the texts)
- code for viewing and working with the archival material in a web interface (delivered from a java servlet)
- a virtual machine that run the servlet interface from any machine with the open-source Virtual Box (<https://www.virtualbox.org/>)  and Vagrant (<http://www.vagrantup.com/>)  software for running virtual machines


The diplomatic edition referred to throughout this paper is not printed here, since it is a digital edition. The images in Chapter 5: Applications and Visualizations are screenshots of the web interface to the digital edition. All work for the project is publicly available online at <http://phoros.github.io/> which is a github repository that allows people to collaborate on open source projects. This address has links to the software for viewing the material and a virtual machine for running the viewing software interactively. All the components are part of the digital version of this project filed with Crossworks. The Athenian Tribute Quota Lists have a massive bibliography and I have read widely on the subject, mostly in English but also in Greek. But there is not a massive bibliography here since this writing is based primarily off ofstudying photos of the inscriptions themselves. This paper is meant as a guide to understanding the Athenian Tribute Quota Lists, the principles I have defined for work on this edition, and a guide to the future study of Athenian imperial tribute.
