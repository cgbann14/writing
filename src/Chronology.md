# Chronology of the Quota Lists #


How do we date the tribute quota lists?

Secondary sources routinely refer to other secondary sources;  could not find in any secondary source an explanation for the traditional dating of Year 1 as 454 BCE.  Often imply that the dating is based on the archon's name in the heading of Year 1.  But as your edition shows, this is not true: the archon's name is entirely restored!

It might be assumed that the reguarly recorded secretary names could help:  Ferguson's Law says that secretaries of the Boule revolved through the ten tribes on a regular cycle.  But as ATL already showed, the secretaries named here do not follow Ferguson's Law:  they cannot be secretaries of the Boule, and must instead refer to the secretary of the Hellenotamiai.  (The quota lists therefore prove that the position of secretary of the Hellenotamiai did *not* rotate through the tribes on a regular cycle.)


Year 34:  on separate stele, with full header giving archon name A. and legible identification as year 34 of the quota lists.

Aristion is datable to  421 BC.  (Cite Bickerman p. 168)  Full ref:  E.J. Bickerman, *Chronology of the Ancient World* (London: Thames and Hudson, 1968)
