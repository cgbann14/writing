# Chronology of the Quota Lists #

I could not find an explanation for the traditional dating of Year 1 as 454 B.C. in any secondary literature. Many sources seem to imply that the dating is based on the archon's name in Year 1's heading. But this is not true, since the archon's name is entirely restored. The only other year that lists an archon name in the header is Year 34, which is not on Stele 1. All other years list the secretary name in the header. Ferguson's Law states that secretaries of the Boule revolved through the ten tribes on a regular cycle. But the secretaries named here do not follow Ferguson's Law:  they cannot be secretaries of the Boule, and must instead refer to the secretary of the Hellenotamiai. *ATL* Volume I has a roster of the Hellenotamiai, which shows that they did not rotate through rotate through the tribes on a regular cycle.

The Hellenotamiai names cannot be used for dating purposes as archons can. So we must turn to our only year with a preserved Archon name: Year 34. This year has a long header, similar to that of Year 1, that has both the Archon name and the number of the year preserved. The archon Aristion is datable to  421 B.C. (Bickerman 168). Therefore, this locks the first year of the Athenian Tribute Quota Lists as 454 B.C. Hopefully this appendix can save someone else from my frustration with this chronology.
