 I have laid the groundwork for reexamining the primary source material in innovative ways-- exploring multiple dimensions 
The more I have studied the evidence, the harder it has become to make sweeping generalizations about the ATL. 
Athenians didnâ€™t take a simple systematic approach to assessment and recording of tribute. Record-keeping practices adapted, payment amounts changed on a seemingly ad-hoc basis,--nuanced and complex system
w/ more development & future work, this new approach can get at the heart of what is happening in Athens and the Mediterranean in the 5th century BC
