# Conclusions #


An article entitled *The Wrongful Execution of the Hellênotamiai (Antiphon 5.69–71) and the Lapis Primus* published in *Classical Philology* in January 2014, during the second semester of my thesis work, demonstrates how pressing the need for a digital edition of the Athenian Tribute Quota Lists is. Stephen Tracey makes a compelling argument in his article  that Year 6 is missing because of the tragedy of the wronful execution of the treasurers of Athena. He points to internal difficulties, showing that there were serious irregularities in Years 7-8 following the tragedy. 



The more time I have spent poring over photos of the stones that compose the Athenian Tribute Quota Lists rather than a neatly organized print edition,  the harder it has become to make sweeping generalizations about the inscriptions. States come in and out of the record. They pay as part of a group one year and as an individual state the next. Sometimes a state  pays twice in one year. Payment amounts change on a seemingly ad-hoc basis. Record-keeping practices change over the years. Based on my edition of the first eight years of the quota lists, I can confidently say that the Athenians did not take a simple systematic approach to the assessment and recording of tribute in this period, but rather had a nuanced and evolving system. Instead of trying to impose macro patterns, such as assessment periods, upon the lists we should examine the data on a micro level and let the stones speak to us. 

My thesis is only the beginning of work that should be done with the Athenian Tribute Quota Lists. I have laid the groundwork for reexamining the primary source material in innovative ways and exploring the many dimensions (e.g., sequencing, geography) of the data. I have defined my editorial principles clearly with the intention that  someone else can pick them up and begin where I left off. With more development and future work, this new approach to studying the Athenian Tribute Quota Lists can get at the heart of what is happening in Athens and the Mediterranean in the fifth century B.C.
