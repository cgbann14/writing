Ferguson's Law explains that there is a recurring pattern of secretaries from the 10 Cleisthenic tribes. Therefore two secretaries from the same tribe must be ten years apart. 


Year 1 lists the archon on the obverse face and the secretary on the right lateral face. This is the only year where the archon appears; all other years follow a formula for listing the secretary only. The archon name in year 1 is completely restored as Ἀρίστονος, 454's archon. The ATL reconstruction does not have a tribe linked with the archon, although this is the formula used for secretaries. The archon names for 464, Ἀρχεδημίδης, and 474, Ἀχεστορίδης, both have two more letters. However, since all of the text preceding ἄρχοντος is restored, this is not necessarily a conflict.
