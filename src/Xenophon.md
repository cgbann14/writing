Ways and Means

In 1.1 Xenophon says that Athens had the same understanding of justice as others, but needed to be unjust to the allies so that the Athenians would not be impoverished. 
(ἐπεὶ δὲ τῶν Ἀθήνησι προεστηκότων ἔλεγόν τινες ὡς γιγνώσκουσι μὲν τὸ δίκαιον οὐδενὸς ἧττον τῶν ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων, διὰ δὲ τὴν τοῦ πλήθους πενίαν ἀναγκάζεσθαι ἔφασαν ἀδικώτεροι εἶναι περὶ τὰς πόλεις)

This sounds similar to Plutarch in section 25 of the *Life of Aristides* where Aristides said that the proposal to move the treasury "was unjust, but that it was to Athens' advantage."

Xenophon explains that the Persian war had two results for Athens: hegemony of the navy and trusteeship of the treasury (5.5). This was not accomplished through force but by doing good services for the Greeks (εὐεργετοῦντες). This statement seems to contradict his initial statement that the Athenians needed to be unjust toward other Greeks.
