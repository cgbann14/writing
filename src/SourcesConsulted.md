This article provides an in depth examination of the discrepancy between Thucydides’ statement that the first assessment of phoros was 460 talents and the evidence of the Athenian Tribute Lists which estimates 297 talents for that same year. It proposes solutions for resolving this problem, especially that Thucydides’ figure reflected both the monetary tribute payments and the value of triremes given as payment.

The author proposes explanations for the discrepancy between the literary and epigraphic sources.

The author suggests a methodology for dating and examining fifth-century inscriptions more sound than the traditional reliance on “letter-forms,” which is crucial for understanding the transformation from the Delian league as an alliance against the Persians to an empire.

Describes the process of the insertion of fragment 10a into the “lapis primus” reconstruction. McGregor argues that one line must be inserted in order for the spacing to fit together properly; therefore column I-IX of List 2 contained eighteen rather than seventeen names.
