In order to better filter the data, I have established identifiers to signify the epigraphic confidence levels of place names. These are not based on historical context, geography, or patterns within the text. Rather, they are based on the visual epigraphic evidence: the clarity of the letters.  The highest level is "extant": the place name is completely visible on the stone or there is no other possible reading. A few letters may be unclear or missing (e.g. the common masculine ending ΟΙ) but there is virtually no doubt as to the reading. 

The middle level is "confident": there has been a significant restoration, but there is good reason to believe it is correct. There may be more than one potential reading. 

The lowest level is "restored": the reading has been either completely restored by the ATL editors or there is so little extant epigraphic evidence (e.g. one letter) that there are several possible readings. 

All three levels may contain partially restored readings. Therefore, the confidence levels do not simply denote whether a reading has been restored or not; the markup tag <supplied> serves this purpose. The levels are intended to denote the true reliability of the reading and therefore to avoid arbitrary classifications (a place name missing its last letter is no less semantically clear than if it were fully extant). 

N.B. When there are only a few letters preserved in a line and no restoration has been attempted by the ATL editors, then it has not been tagged as a specific place and therefore there will be no confidence level applied to it.
