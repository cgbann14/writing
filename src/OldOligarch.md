There is a big distinction made between things done every year and things done from time to time. The author first describes duties that the Athenian government constantly has to deal with as they arise: πολλὰ δὲ περὶ τῶν κατὰ πόλιν ἀεὶ γιγνομένων (3.2). Among these duties is the receipt of tribute: φόρον δέξασθαι (3.2). The discussion then shifts to annual duties 
such as the appointment of trierarchs. This section ends with the statement: ταῦτα μὲν οὖν ὅσα ἔτη (3.5). The sentence immediately following this starts with the phrase διὰ χρόνου, "at times," which sharply contrasts with those things done every year. This includes unexpected issues(ἐξαπιναῖον ἀδίκημα γίγνηται) such as instances of hubris. The author then says he has skipped over many things, but he has discussed the most important except for the assessment of tribute (αἱ τάξεις τοῦ φόρου). This still seems to be in the category of things that happen διὰ χρόνου. Therefore, when he describes assessment as occurring τοῦτο δὲ γιγνεται ὡς τὰ πολλὰ δι’ ἔτους πέμπτου, the ὡς τὰ πολλὰ has more force. If reassessment had consistently occurred on a quadrennial basis, it would fit better with the structure of the Old Oligarch's essay to mention it along with Athens' annual duties rather than with its occasional duties.
