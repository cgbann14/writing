# Appendix 1: Overview of important literary sources #


{>>Add note:  in contrast to the epigraphic material you worked on, the problem of how to edit a digital edition of
literary texts like the ones listed here is much better understand.  Could point to examples like the Perseus project, where
openly licensed XML editions are available for download.   It would therefore not be difficult to add to an archive or source 
material for phoros a collection of literary texts.  But we still need to ask:  what texts?  Why?  This appendix lists
the major literary sources.<<}

While I have focused on studying the epigraphic evidence, the literary evidence is also essential to understanding tribute. Neither can give the whole picture in isolation. The sources listed here should be studied alongside the Athenian Tribute Quota Lists. While the quota lists can tell us about changes in tribute over time, the literary sources can answer the most basic question: what is φόρος /tribute? What did φόρος represent? Why did the Athenians record 1/60th of it so painstakingly on stone?



#Old Oligarch/Pseudo-Xenophon#

{>>WHat is the text?  In what context does reference to tribute arise?<<}
This text is essential for understanding the regularity of tribute reassessment. The Old Oligarch makes a big distinction made between things done every year and things done from time to time. The author first describes duties that the Athenian government constantly has to deal with as they arise: πολλὰ δὲ περὶ τῶν κατὰ πόλιν ἀεὶ γιγνομένων (3.2). Among these duties is the receipt of tribute: φόρον δέξασθαι (3.2). The discussion then shifts to annual duties such as the appointment of trierarchs. This section ends with the statement: ταῦτα μὲν οὖν ὅσα ἔτη (3.5). The sentence immediately following this starts with the phrase διὰ χρόνου, "at times," which sharply contrasts with those things done every year. This includes unexpected issues(ἐξαπιναῖον ἀδίκημα γίγνηται) such as instances of hubris. The author then says he has skipped over many things, but he has discussed the most important except for the assessment of tribute (αἱ τάξεις τοῦ φόρου). This still seems to be in the category of things that happen διὰ χρόνου. Therefore, when he describes assessment as occurring τοῦτο δὲ γιγνεται ὡς τὰ πολλὰ δι’ ἔτους πέμπτου, the ὡς τὰ πολλὰ has more force. If reassessment had consistently occurred on a quadrennial basis, it would fit better with the structure of the Old Oligarch's essay to mention it along with Athens' annual duties rather than with its occasional duties. I think the theory,  set out in *The Athenian Tribute Lists* and *The Athenian Empire*, that there was a reassessment every four years at the Great Panathenaea is difficult to reconcile with this passage expecially since we only have evidence for one comprehensive reassessment: the Reassessment Decree. The digital edition could be utilized to re-examine the question of reassessment in a more efficient way. 


# Thucydides #


## Book 1 ##

{>>Add contextualizing note:  important discussion of the Pentekontaeteia<<}
The word φόρος is used in the singular to mean the whole tribute for that year while the plural is used to mean discrete payments made by individual allies. In 1.99.1 the plural is used (in the genitive:τῶν φόρων).
There is an important distinction between the use of the word χρῆμα, money, and the word φόρος, tribute, in Thucydides. In 1.99.3 he says, χρήματα ἐτάξαντο ἀντὶ τῶν νεῶν τὸ ἱκνούμενον ἀνάλωμα φέρειν. The word ἐτάξαντο here can be translated as "arranged" and it has the sense that the allies who no longer wished to contribute ships negotiated with the Athenians to pay money instead. This use of τάσσω in the middle voice conveys that they made arrangements for their own benefit. This usage parallels the header on the second stele of the tribute lists which reads "πολεῖς αὐταί ταξάμεναι." Perhaps the poleis under this heading previously contributed ships?

This negotiation seems like it is only referring to those allies which were originally assessed to contribute ships. In 1.96 Thucydides states that the Athenians determined which would contribute ships and which money. The same verb τάσσω is used here (ἔταξαν)in the aorist, showing that it was the Athenians that decided how the allies would contribute to the league, not the allies themselves. It is only later that the Athenians were willing to negotiate with those allies assessed to contribute ships. But since the word χρῆμα is used, they were not necessarily contributing tribute.
Instead, their contributions could have gone to a separate Athenian naval fund devoted to maintaining the triremes and paying the sailors. This fund would not have been sacred and therefore would probably have been recorded on a more temporary material instead of stone. This is more consistent with the Athenians' initial assessment. They decided who needed to make naval contributions and who needed to make monetary contributions. When the allies arranged to pay money instead of ships, they could still be making a naval contribution consistent with the initial decision.
In 1.101.3 the distinction between money and tribute is further highlighted. They paid the χρήματά at once and agreed to bring more later.
ναῦς παραδόντες, χρήματά τε ὅσα ἔδει ἀποδοῦναι αὐτίκα ταξάμενοι καὶ τὸ λοιπὸν φέρειν,

## Book 2 ##

{>>Again, add note on context:  what is going on here in Thuc?<<}
The amount assessed and the amount paid do not necessarily need to be identical in order to be correct. Thucydides uses the phrase ἐπὶ πολύ to modify the annual revenue from the allies. LSJ translates this as “very generally" "for the most part" and it is very similar to ὡς τὰ πολλὰ, the phrase used by the Old Oligarch to describe how often tribute was assessed.
This approximate phrasing may be due to partial and late payments.


#Xenophon's *Ways and Means* #

{>>Note:  what is this work?<<}
In 1.1 Xenophon says that Athens had the same understanding of justice as others, but needed to be unjust to the allies so that the Athenians would not be impoverished. (ἐπεὶ δὲ τῶν Ἀθήνησι προεστηκότων ἔλεγόν τινες ὡς γιγνώσκουσι μὲν τὸ δίκαιον οὐδενὸς ἧττον τῶν ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων, διὰ δὲ τὴν τοῦ πλήθους πενίαν ἀναγκάζεσθαι ἔφασαν ἀδικώτεροι εἶναι περὶ τὰς πόλεις)
This sounds similar to Plutarch in section 25 of the Life of Aristides where Aristides said that the proposal to move the treasury "was unjust, but that it was to Athens' advantage."
Xenophon explains that the Persian war had two results for Athens: hegemony of the navy and trusteeship of the treasury (5.5). This was not accomplished through force but by doing good services for the Greeks (εὐεργετοῦντες). This statement seems to contradict his initial statement that the Athenians needed to be unjust toward other Greeks.
