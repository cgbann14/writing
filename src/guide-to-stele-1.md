#Guide to Reading the First Eight Years of the Quota Lists#


The Athenian Tribute Quota Lists recorded the aparchai on four stelae for the 49{>>(???ATL number)<<} years of tribute collection. I edited the first eight years of the lists, which are inscribed on Stele 1. Years 1-7 are inscribed on the obverse face and Year 8 is inscribed on the right lateral face. 

Each year should be understood as an individual document. Stele 1 itself is not a single document, since it was inscribed on an annual basis over the course of many years. There is a heading for each document that gives the relative number of the year (i.e.: first, second) and the name of the secretary (Hellenotamiai). While the relative year numbers do not correlate to the beginning of tribute collection at Delos, there is a sense that the quota lists were the beginning of something (i.e. the first time the league treasury was housed in Athens, the first time aparchai was given to Athena). Underneath the header there are multiple columns listing the aparchai payment amount and the name of the place that contributed. The place name is usually, but not always, written as the nominative plural name for its people.

The inscriptions  use the stoichedon method. This term is derived from the adverb στοιχηδόν translated as “in a row.” Everything is written using capital letters and there are no spaces between words. Stoichedon inscriptions are laid out in a grid pattern where each character gets one space. However, the quota lists are not perfectly stoichedon. Since place names and payment amounts are of varying lengths, the layout is not nearly as uniform as a stoichedon decree. While one payment will be expressed using seven characters, a different amount will only require one character. This same principle applies to place names, since different names are spelled using different amounts of letters. Therefore one line may use all of the available space and another may have blank gaps where the space was not needed. 

The lists use the Attic alphabet which is slightly different from the alphabet readers of literary Ancient Greek are familiar with. No accents or breath marks are used. The table below allows the reader to convert the text to normalized literary Greek.

The payments are inscribed using the Attic acrophonic numeral system. The character used to represent a number is determined by the first letter of the word for that letter (e.g. Π represents 5 drachmae because the word for five is πέντε). Unlike the Roman numeral system, the acrophonic system is only additive (e.g. 9 drachmae is ΠΙΙΙΙ not ΙΔ). The number five in increasing orders of magnitude are represented with composites of pi (e.g. 50 is written as a delta nesting within a pi since 5X10=50).

The following is a guide to reading each of the first eight years. I have noted exceptions to the general format of the list and changes in recording practices. 

Year 1 was inscribed at the top of Stele 1's obverse face. Its header is four lines long. The list contains six columns on the obverse face with 24 rows in each (the numbering for the columns starts at line 5 to account for the header). In each column, the place name is inscribed first on the left side of the column. The corresponding payment amount is inscribed on the right side of the same column. The place name and its payment amount are consistently separated in Year 1 by a punctuation mark that is two vertically stacked dots. 

!{Punctuation Mark}[year1drawing]



In Year 1 there are multiple instances (Column II lines 25-26, Column IV lines 4-5, Column IV lines 12-13, Column IV lines 17-18, Column IV lines 19-20, Column V lines 3-4, Column V lines 4-5, Column V lines 11-12)  of long place names that are written across two separate lines (e.g.: "halikar" on line 12 and "nasses" on line 13). However, there is no similar instance of a single long place name that was arbitrarily divided in two parts on two lines after Year 1. 

!{Column IV lines 12-13}[HalikarnassesYr1]


After year 1, the only instances when two lines are used for a single entry occur when there is a copayment (ie: two distinct places pay together, with one name on each line) and when there is a place name that contains multiple words. This practice of splitting a "compound" name across two lines according to their inherent word divisions is common throughout the lists but the practice of simply splitting a long name halfway and inscribing it on two separate lines does not continue after Year 1. This must be the reason for the abbreviated forms in Year 2, Column X. 

Year 2 is the only other list inscribed across two faces of Stele 1. But unlike Year 1 which has a postscript on its right lateral face, Year 2's right lateral face is a continuation of its list and contains columns VIII, IX, and X. Its header is one line long and each column has 17 entries. Column X is shorter with only 10 entries and there is preserved blank space beneath the tenth entry on stone 11 before the start of year 8. Three entries in Column X appear to be abbreviated because the stonecutter ran out of room on the right lateral face. Line 5 has ΒΟΥΘΕΙΕ for ΒΟΥΘΕΙΕΣ; line 6 has  ΧΕΡΡΟΝΕ for  ΧΕΡΡΟΝΕΣΙΤΑΙ; line 11 has ΔΙΔΥΜΟΤΕΙ for ΔΙΔΥΜΟΤΕΙΧΙΤΑΙ. Although since there is plenty of spare space at the end of Column X, the stonecutter seemingly could have used two lines to write these three names instead of abbreviating them. However, I think the answer must be that the convention changed and it was no longer for the stonecutter to allow a single place name to run over onto a second line when it was not a compound name.  

!{Year 2, Column X}[abbreviations]


In Year 2 Column VI, line 14 the amount reads 5 drachmae, 2 drachmae, and 3 obols equalling 45 obols. But the ATL editors believe that the stonecutter mistakenly inscribed 2 drachmae and 3 obols instead of correctly inscribing 3 drachmae  and two obols, which would equal 50 obols. I have chosen to leave the character as it appears on the stone and in their drawings: as an obol. My edition seeks to represent what is extant on the stone. I have refrained from making judgments about potential stonecutter errors.  

!{ Year 2 Column VI, line 14}[stonecuttermistake]

Year 3 is inscribed on the obverse face only. It has a single line header and 5 columns each with 30 entries. A single payment record may take up more than one line. It is not uncommon for a long place name to be split across two lines, but it is rare for a payment amount to do so. Year 3, Column 3, lines 2-3 is one example of this rare case. On line 2, the first half of the place name is inscribed “ΒΕΡΥ<ΣΙΟΙ>” and the rest of the name is inscribed on line 3 “ΗΥΠΟΤΕ<ΙΙΔΕΙ>.” The payment is also split across two lines. Line 2 lists  10 drachmae, 5 drachmae, and 1 drachma; line 3 lists 4 obols. Together these two lines form the single payment of 100 obols, just as together the two lines form a single place name.

Year 4 is inscribed on the obverse face only, and each of its five columns has 32 lines. None of the columns has its bottom preserved, so the list was most likely longer than 32 lines per column. 


Year 5 is inscribed on the obverse face only, and each of its five columns has 41 lines. Column II, lines 13-17 form a group payment, although no payment amount is preserved. 

There is no record for Year 6. The end of Year 5 clearly and the heading of Year 7 are both extant enough to show definitively that there was not another list between them. Therefore, the absence of Year 6 is not simply an accident of preservation. 


Year 7 has four columns with 38 lines each and is inscribed on the obverse face only. In Column III, from lines 28-32 there is a large "copayment" of six different places paying together. In line 28 there is a place (most likely ΕΡΥΘΡΑΙΟΙ but only ΟΙ is preserved) that is consistent with the typical letter size of the list. But lines 29-32 were inscribed using significantly smaller letters. This text is highly unusual. It explains that Erythrai paid for itself and for Polichne, while Sidousa, Boutheia, Elaiousa, and Pteleon all paid for themselves. These six places formed one joint payment; the amount is not preserved on the stone, but is restored as 900 drachmae. 

!{Year 7, Column III, lines 28-32}[ErythraiGroup]



There is another oddity in Year 7, Column IV, line 2. The last 4 obols of the payment for Lampsakos are written slightly underneath the rest of the payment. This seems to have caused the next few payments to be slightly misaligned with their corresponding place names. 

!{Year 7, Column IV, line 2}[Lampsakos]


Year 8 is inscribed on the right lateral face only. It has 2 columns with 113 lines each, but the bottom of neither column is preserved. Its header is four lines long. Since the right lateral face is much narrower than the obverse face, the header and columns are longer than those years inscribed on the obverse face. Year 8 begins by repeating the names of Year 7 in a similar order. In Column 1, lines 58-64, there is a large group payment by six members of the Erythrai syntely. On line 60, there is a sentence that extends across Column I into Column II. I have edited the entire line in Column I because that is where it belongs semantically, and have put a `<gap>` in Column II to show that there is not another entry in that space. 
 This large group entry has a unique organization. The stonecutter inscribed at least one character on each line of the group entry, so that the entire amount is  distributed across seven lines. This is the only instance in the first eight years of the quota lists where a group payment was inscribed in this way.

!{Year 8, Column 1, lines [ErythraiSentence]


Byzantion is listed twice in Year 8: once in line 103 and again immediately underneath in line 104.  In each line, the amount is split with some numerals on the left side of the place name (where they typically go) and the right side of the place name. We can be sure that the numerals on the right side belong with Byzantion and not another entry in Column 2 because there are punctuation marks separating them. 

!{Year 8, Column 1, lines 103-104}[doubleByzantion]


The first evidence for partial payments and arrears occurs in Year 8. Column 5 is, at least partially, a "complementary appendix" listing several names that are already listed earlier for the same year as well as arrears.
