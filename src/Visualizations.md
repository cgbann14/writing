1. Chronological Chart of Payment Record Sequence

![Chart of Payment Records][images/PayRecChart.png]

This is a chronological list of all the payments. It is useful for analyses of the sequences of different years. If there are repeated sequences of different poleis in the same order or in similar orders, this could tell us something about the administrative practices of the hellenotamiai. 


2. Chart of Surviving Records Listed by Polis

![Alphabetical Chart of Surviving Records][images/PolisChart.png]


This chart lists each polis alphabetically. The entry for a year will be red if the place name is not preserved for that year. This could mean that the polis did not pay tribute that year or it could mean that there is simply no extant record of its payment. The entry for a year will be orange if the place name is preserved but the payment amount is not. The entry will be green and an amount will be listed if both the payment amount and place name are extant for a year.  This is useful as a reference to track one city's payment records over every year.



3. Map of Payments Adjustable by Year and Amount

![Map of All Payments for the First Eight Years][images/MapYrAmt.png]

When nothing is selected this map shows all of the payment records for the first eight years. The graphs beneath the map can be used to select the information displayed on the map. The lefthand graph shows the amount of payment records per year. The righthand graph shows the number of payments per each payment amount.


![Map of High Payers in Years 7 and 8][images/MapYr78.png] 
This is an example of a display when both the years and payment amounts are selected. Years 7 and 8 are selected and the highest payment amounts are selected. This shows which places paid the most in Years 7 and 8 and where they are located geographically. 


4. Map of Surviving Records of Payments by Year

![Extant Records for Year 1][images/MapExtantYr1.png]

This visualization shows which places have extant records for a certain year. All of the places from the entire corpus of place names from the first eight years are plotted on the map, but those with records for the selected year appear larger and colored green on the map. This example displays all of the extant payment records for Year 1. 


5. Map of the Changes in Payment and the Payment Amounts by Year

![Map Displaying Changes and Sizes in Payments for Year 5][images/MapPayChange.png]


The relative amount of a payment is represented by the size of the circle used to plot it on a map. The colors of the circles represent changes (or lack thereof) from the previous record for each individual place. This example is selected to display Year 5. The colors do not show the Year 5's payments in relation to Year 4's payments. Rather, the color for each individual place represents its relation to the previous record for that place. Therefore, if a polis paid in Year 1 and did not pay again until Year 5, the color displayed in this view would be in relation to its payment in Year 1. This map can be used to track the changes in payments for various places over time. 


6. Map of the Sequence of Payments and the Amounts of Payments by Year

![Map of Year 1 Sequence][images/MapSequencing.png]

As in the previous map, the relative amount of a payment is represented by the size of the circle used to plot it on a map. The color of the circle represents its sequence in the list for that year. All circles are on a gradient from green, the first polis listed, to red, the last polis listed. The example shown is selected to display Year 1.
