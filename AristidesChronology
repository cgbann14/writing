Cornelius Nepos states that Aristides died four years after Themistocles was ostracized. 


Diodorus states in 11.54-55 that Themistocles was ostracized when Praxiergus was archon in Athens, placing the event in 471 B.C.E. He explains the institution of ostracism, saying that the exile period was five years- does this effect the accuracy of his date (since he does not say it was the usual ten years)?

Pericles produced Aeschylus' *The Persians* in 472 and due to the play's tndirect tribute to Themistocles, Peter Green takes this as evidence that it was meant to influence the outcome of his trial (115-116).


Plutarch acknowledges difficulties in chronology in section 27 of his *Life of Themistocles*. He says that according to Thucydides and Charon of Lampsacus, Themistocles spoke with Xerxes while according to Ephorus, Dinon, Clitarchus, Heracleides, and many other authorities he spoke with Artaxerxes I. Artaxerxes did not succeed his father until 465 B.C.E. (Green)

These sources in conjunction with Cornelius Nepos' account put Aristides' death either in 468 or 461 B.C.E. 
Either way, Aristides would have died before 454 B.C.E. when the treasury was moved from Delos to Athens. But in Plutarch has Aristides commenting on this event, "Aristides said that the proposal was unjust, but that it was to Athens' advantage." (section 25)
