OCD Delos: "The Egyptian expedition ended in disaster for Athens in 454, and in that year the treasury was moved from Delos to Athens (?for security in this moment of peril; but the date of the move is not absolutely certain)."

Wikipedia cites Thucydides 1.96, but there is no mention of the treasury move there.
